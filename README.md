💰 This project redefines the traditional quadratic funding model to enhance flexibility, privacy, and cross-chain functionality. Our platform seamlessly facilitates funding across various EVM-compatible chains. Our dApp integrates with the Secret Network to encrypt contribution data, ensuring that all donations remain confidential. This integration not only protects user privacy but also enhances security for all parties involved. Unlike traditional models that are strictly quadratic, our platform provides the unique ability to customize the funding curve. Project creators can now choose from a variety of curve types to best suit their fundraising needs.

⚙️ Built using NextJS, RainbowKit, Hardhat, Wagmi, Viem, and Typescript.

- ⛓️ **Cross-chain funding**: Participate in funding rounds from any EVM-compatible blockchain.
- 🔏 **Private Contributions**: All contributions are encrypted using Secret Network’s cutting-edge technology, ensuring total privacy.
- 📈 **Customizable Funding Curves**: Choose from quadratic or alternative curve structures to optimize your project’s funding potential.

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

<!-- ## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo & install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2.git
cd scaffold-eth-2
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

Run smart contract test with `yarn hardhat:test`

- Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
- Edit your frontend in `packages/nextjs/pages`
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy` -->
